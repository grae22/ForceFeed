x DB
  x MongoDB. [Status: Has been set up.]
  x Store changelists, but not actual file content (too much data, can be obtained from p4 server as needed). [Status: WIP]
    x Changelists currently stored.

x Db Feeder
  x App to periodically poll p4 for changes and update the db accordingly. [Status: Done.]
      
x Web-server
  x Web server to provide front-end with data from the db. [Status: Done.]
  x Requires extension to serve file content as requested from front-end.
  
x Front-end
  x List changelists. [Status: Done, could look better.]
  x Allow sorting by data or user. [Status: None]
  x Allow filtering by users. [Status: Done.]
  x Expand changelists to show files. [Status: Done, could look better.]
  x Expand files to show diff content. [Status: WIP]
    x Front-end still to request file and web-server to serve it.
